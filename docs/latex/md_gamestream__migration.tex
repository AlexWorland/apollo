Nvidia announced that their Game\+Stream service for Nvidia Games clients will be discontinued in February 2023. Luckily, Sunshine performance is now equal to or better than Nvidia Game\+Stream.\hypertarget{md_gamestream__migration_autotoc_md95}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Migration}{Migration}}\label{md_gamestream__migration_autotoc_md95}
We have developed a simple migration tool to help you migrate your Game\+Stream games and apps to Sunshine automatically. Please check out our \href{https://github.com/LizardByte/GSMS}{\texttt{GSMS}} project if you\textquotesingle{}re interested in an automated migration option. GSMS offers the ability to migrate your custom and auto-\/detected games and apps. The working directory, command, and image are all set in Sunshine\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily apps.\+json} file. The box-\/art image is also copied to a specified directory.\hypertarget{md_gamestream__migration_autotoc_md96}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Internet Streaming}{Internet Streaming}}\label{md_gamestream__migration_autotoc_md96}
If you are using the Moonlight Internet Hosting Tool, you can remove it from your system when you migrate to Sunshine. To stream over the Internet with Sunshine and a UPn\+P-\/capable router, enable the UPnP option in the Sunshine Web UI.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Running Sunshine together with versions of the Moonlight Internet Hosting Tool prior to v5.\+6 will cause UPnP port forwarding to become unreliable. Either uninstall the tool entirely or update it to v5.\+6 or later.
